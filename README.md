MovieBoxNext is a chrome extension that shows the next button (as seen on mobile) at the end of an episode. By pressing this button you'll be automatically redirected and the next episode will load.

How to install this extension:  

1. Download and unpack this repo

## Usage

The default time the button shows up before the end of the episode is `60` seconds. This can be changed by clicking on the extension icon and changing the `time left`.
